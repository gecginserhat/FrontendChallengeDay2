- Basic Selectors: Mastering selectors to target elements effectively.<br/>
- Web Development Tools: Leveraging developer tools for efficient styling.<br/>
- Colors: Working with RGB, Hex values, and opacity.<br/>
- Backgrounds: Setting up background colors and images.<br/>
- Borders & Radius: Adding borders and rounding corners.<br/>
- Dimensions: Controlling width, height, and max-width.<br/>
- Display Properties: Understanding block, inline, and inline-block elements.<br/>
- Box Model: Margins, padding, and box-sizing for perfect layouts.<br/>
- Text Properties: Styling text with fonts, size, and alignment.<br/>

🔥 CSS is incredibly powerful! Excited to experiment with more advanced techniques tomorrow.<br/>
